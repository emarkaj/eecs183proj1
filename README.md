# eecs183proj1

This is my individual work on project 1 for the University of Michigan's EECS 183 - Intro to Programming course.

This code asks for an integer input from the user in the form of number of people they would like to serve. It then outputs an integer of how many loaf/loaves the person needs to make along with a list and number of ingredients required to make said loaves.

Utilizes pluralization function (created by EECS 183 faculty) to turn loaf-->loaves etc. as needed.
